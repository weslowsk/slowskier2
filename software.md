## SETS
<p style="width: 100%">
Slow Skier Electronic Time Sheet (SETS) is a unique, simplistic time recording and reporting system. SETS was developed to address a niche gap in time recording software in 2011. It combines the simplicity of entering a task for a block of time in a day with the reporting, aggregation, and searchability of those tasks. SETS allows users to define their own tasks to suit their time recording needs. Users can be as descriptive as they want to describe individual tasks.

The software was originally built as a Vaadin 6 application that used Google Calendar as the backend data source. The core principle of SETS is that the calendaring backend is reliable and stable but lacking in reporting and the ability to quickly enter data. SETS fills that gap. Over the years, SETS has been rewritten in Vaadin 8 and Vaadin 14, the current version. A registration module allows users to register and bind their Google Accounts to their SETS accounts using OAuth.

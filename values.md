<p style="width: 100%">
Slow Skier Consulting Inc. has several principles and values that guide how we provide service to our clients.
</p>

## Minimizing Costs
<p style="width: 100%">
Minimizing costs is different than being cheap. Your business will often not need the most grandiose solution to meet your needs, even though these types of solutions are often popular in the marketplace. Why are so many companies experiencing frustration with de facto products and solutions? Because not enough creativity is used in designing a solution that does just what those companies need. Our solutions are customized to your business' budget and requirements and often supplant traditional, over-architected solutions with equivalent or better results.
</p>

## Maximizing Longevity of Solutions
<p style="width: 100%">
When a solution is delivered, you want the solution to last a while. Depending on your business, advances in IT, and changes in your business, this may be a few years or a few decades. Our focus is on getting you as much value out of the delivered solution as possible.
</p>

## High Quality Solutions

<p style="width: 100%">
We have designed and implemented polished systems that smoothly deliver functionality to users. We have delivered well thought out documentation that clearly explains what the user is receiving and how to use it. We do not cut corners. We refuse to have our name attributed to inferior quality designs and solutions. You will see the thoroughness in our work. Do it right or don't do it at all.
</p>

## High Ethical Standards
<p style="width: 100%">
Fairness and ethics is paramount in how we conduct our business. If you are looking for an aboveboard, reputable consultant that stands behind every business transaction, you have come to the right place. If you conduct questionable business practices or are seeking a business partner in disreputable transactions, we will not be able to do business together. There is no “padding numbers”, “slack time”, or “blended rates” here. There is only raw effort for requested services. This is one area where we believe there is only black and white.
